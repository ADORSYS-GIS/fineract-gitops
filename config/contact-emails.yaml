# Centralized Contact Email Configuration
#
# This file serves as the single source of truth for operational contact emails
# used across the Fineract GitOps repository.
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: When changing contact emails (e.g., team changes, domain migration):
#     1. Update the emails in this file
#     2. Update the environment-specific configurations below
#     3. Test SSL certificate renewals (Let's Encrypt notifications)
#     4. Commit all changes together
#
# Email Types:
# - SSL_CERT_EMAIL: Receives Let's Encrypt certificate expiration warnings
# - CONTACT_EMAIL: General contact for the environment
# - ONCALL_EMAIL: On-call/SRE team contact for production

---
# Global/Default Emails
# These are used when environment-specific emails are not defined
GLOBAL:
  SSL_CERT_EMAIL: "platform-team@example.com"
  PLATFORM_EMAIL: "platform-team@example.com"

---
# Development Environment
DEV:
  CONTACT_EMAIL: "dev-team@example.com"
  SSL_CERT_EMAIL: "platform-team@example.com"  # Can use generic for dev/staging certs

---
# UAT Environment
UAT:
  CONTACT_EMAIL: "qa-team@example.com"
  SSL_CERT_EMAIL: "platform-team@example.com"

---
# Production Environment
PRODUCTION:
  CONTACT_EMAIL: "platform-team@example.com"
  ONCALL_EMAIL: "sre-team@example.com"
  SSL_CERT_EMAIL: "platform-team@example.com"  # IMPORTANT: Must receive cert expiration warnings

---
# SMTP Configuration (AWS SES)
# Regional endpoints for email delivery
AWS_SES_REGIONS:
  DEV: "us-east-2"        # Ohio region - primary
  UAT: "us-east-2"        # Ohio region - consistency with dev
  PRODUCTION: "us-east-2" # Ohio region - must match Terraform aws_region

# SMTP Endpoint Format: email-smtp.{region}.amazonaws.com
# Port: 587 (STARTTLS) - standard for SES
#
# Regional Alignment:
# - All environments currently use us-east-2 (Ohio)
# - Must align with Terraform AWS provider region configuration
# - If deploying multi-region, update per environment in:
#   operations/keycloak-config/overlays/{env}/kustomization.yaml
#
# Latency Considerations:
# - Use SES region closest to EKS cluster for best performance
# - Cross-region SES calls add 50-100ms latency
#
# Regional SES Endpoints (Reference):
# - us-east-1: email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
# - us-east-2: email-smtp.us-east-2.amazonaws.com (CURRENT)
# - us-west-2: email-smtp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
# - eu-west-1: email-smtp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

# Usage Notes:
#
# 1. SSL Certificate Emails (Let's Encrypt):
#    - Receives notifications 30 days and 7 days before expiration
#    - Must be monitored and acted upon
#    - Located in: apps/cert-manager/base/letsencrypt-*.yaml
#
# 2. Environment Contact Emails:
#    - Used in environment kustomization.yaml metadata
#    - Visible in kubectl describe for environment resources
#    - Located in: environments/{dev,uat,production}/kustomization.yaml
#
# 3. SMTP Configuration (Keycloak):
#    - AWS SES regional endpoints configured per environment
#    - Must match Terraform AWS region for SES resources
#    - Located in: operations/keycloak-config/overlays/{env}/kustomization.yaml
#    - SMTP credentials stored in sealed secrets
#
# 4. Migration Example:
#    When changing from example.com to mycompany.com:
#    ```bash
#    # Update this file
#    sed -i 's/@example.com/@mycompany.com/g' config/contact-emails.yaml
#
#    # Update cert-manager
#    sed -i 's/@example.com/@mycompany.com/g' apps/cert-manager/base/letsencrypt-*.yaml
#
#    # Update environments
#    sed -i 's/@example.com/@mycompany.com/g' environments/*/kustomization.yaml
#    ```
