# PRODUCTION: Exclude demo data jobs by using a filter
# We'll manually document which jobs to skip for production deployment
# Alternatively, production can manually sync only the jobs it needs

  description: "Production environment - configuration and products ONLY (no demo data)"
  warning: "IMPORTANT: Before deploying to production, manually remove demo data jobs (Wave 30-42) or use selective sync"

# NOTE: Production should exclude Wave 30-42 jobs:
# - job-clients.yaml
# - job-loan-accounts.yaml
# - job-savings-accounts.yaml
# - job-loan-collateral.yaml
# - job-loan-guarantors.yaml
# - job-savings-deposits.yaml
# - job-savings-withdrawals.yaml
# - job-loan-repayments.yaml
#
# Recommendation: Use ArgoCD selective sync or create production-specific data ConfigMap
# that excludes demo client/account/transaction data
